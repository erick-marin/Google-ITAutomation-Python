# Practice Quiz: Conditionals
#
# Question 1
# What's the value of this Python expression: (2**2) == 4?

result = (2**2) == 4
print(result)

# [ ] 4
# [ ] 2**2
# [x] True
# [ ] False
#
# Question 2
# Complete the script by filling in the missing parts. The function receives a
# name, then returns a greeting based on whether or not that name is "Taylor".
#


def greeting(name):
    if name == "Taylor":
        return "Welcome back Taylor!"
    else:

# Question 3
# Whatâ€™s the output of this code if number equals 10?


# if number > 11:                     # number = 10
#     print(0)                        # False
# elif number != 10:
#     print(1)                        # False
# elif number >= 20 or number < 12:   # False & True
#     print(2)                        # prints "2"
# else:
#     print(3)

# Question 4
# Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger
# than 100*100? Replace the plus sign in the following code to let Python
# check it for you and then answer.

print("A dog" + "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 + 100*100)

print("A dog" < "A mouse")

# [ ] "A dog" is larger than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100*100
# [x] "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100*100
# [ ] "A dog" is larger than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is smaller than 100*100
# [ ] "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is smaller than 100*100

# Question 5
# If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file
# comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made
# up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2 = 8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can
# you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which
# calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?


def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = filesize // block_size
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = filesize % block_size
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return block_size * full_blocks + 4096
    return block_size * full_blocks


print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096))  # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097))  # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000))  # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(12000)) # Should be 12288
