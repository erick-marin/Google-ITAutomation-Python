# For a program to be useful it needs to get at least some information from
# the user. Data can be provided to a computer in a bunch of different ways.
# Whichever way your application gets the data, it will need to come from
# somewhere.
#
# By having the name separate from the call to the print function,  we're
# making the line of code that calls the print function generic, while still
# personalizing the greeting.
