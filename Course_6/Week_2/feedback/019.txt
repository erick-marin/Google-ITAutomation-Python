Best experience so far

My friend recommended this place and  I decided to give a try. I called them beforehand and made sure they have the models I was looking for. They evenly sent me a bunch of photos and specs of the car I was looking for. One the day I visited, the sales person John helped me with test drive and showed me what I should be aware of when buying a used car. I felt like I learned a lot. They made the process so smooth that I saved a lot of time. It's the best car purchasing experience I had so far!
