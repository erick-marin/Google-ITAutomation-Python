# Practice Quiz: Running Python Locally
#
# 1. When your IDE automatically creates an indent for you, this is known as
# what?
#
# [x] Code completion
# [ ] Syntax highlighting
# [ ] Code reuse
# [ ] Interpreted language

# 2. Can you identify the error in the following code?
#
#     #!/usr/bin/env python3
#     import numpy as np
#
#     def numpyArray():
#         x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)
#         y = numpy.array([[3, 6, 2], [9, 12, 8]], np.int32)
#         return x*y
#     print(numpyArray())
#
# [ ] The shebang line is not necessary.
# [ ] The function is not indented properly.
# [x] The y variable is not calling the numpy module properly.
# [ ] numpy is not imported correctly because as is used.

# 3. Which type of programming language is read and converted to machine code
# before runtime, allowing for more efficient code?
#
# [ ]Object-oriented language
# [x]Compiled language
# [ ]Interpreted language
# [ ]Intermediate code

# 4. Which of the following is not an IDE or code editor?
#
# [ ] Eclipse
# [x] pip
# [ ] Atom
# [ ] PyCharm

# 5. What does the PATH variable do?
#
# [x] Tells the operating system where to find executables
# [ ] Returns the current working directory
# [ ] Holds the command line arguments of your Python program in a list
# [ ] Tells the operating system where where to cache frequently used files
