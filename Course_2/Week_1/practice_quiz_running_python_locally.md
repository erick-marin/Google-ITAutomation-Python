# Practice Quiz: Running Python Locally

 1. When your IDE automatically creates an indent for you, this is known as what?

    [x] Code completion<br>
    [ ] Syntax highlighting<br>
    [ ] Code reuse<br>
    [ ] Interpreted language

 2. Can you identify the error in the following code?

     ```
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     import numpy as np

     def numpyArray():
         x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)
         y = numpy.array([[3, 6, 2], [9, 12, 8]], np.int32)
         return x*y
         
     print(numpyArray())
     ```

    [ ] The shebang line is not necessary.<br>
    [ ] The function is not indented properly.<br>
    [x] The y variable is not calling the numpy module properly.<br>
    [ ] numpy is not imported correctly because as is used.

 3. Which type of programming language is read and converted to machine code before runtime, allowing for more efficient code?

    [ ]Object-oriented language<br>
    [x]Compiled language<br>
    [ ]Interpreted language<br>
    [ ]Intermediate code

 4. Which of the following is not an IDE or code editor?

    [ ] Eclipse<br>
    [x] pip<br>
    [ ] Atom<br>
    [ ] PyCharm

 5. What does the PATH variable do?

    [x] Tells the operating system where to find executables<br>
    [ ] Returns the current working directory<br>
    [ ] Holds the command line arguments of your Python program in a list<br>
    [ ] Tells the operating system where where to cache frequently used files
