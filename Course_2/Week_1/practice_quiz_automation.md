    [ ] if [10 hours to automate > (15 minutes * 60 times per month)] then automate<br>
    [X] if [10 hours to automate < (15 minutes * 60 times per month)] then automate<br>
    [ ] if [(10 hours to automate + 15 minutes) > 60 times per month)] then automate<br>
    [ ] [(10 hours to automate / 60 times per month) < 15 minutes]

 4. A company is looking at automating one of their internal processes and wants to determine if automating a process would save labor time this year. The company uses the formula [time_to_automate < (time_to_perform * amount_of_times_done) to decide whether automation is worthwhile. The process normally takes about 10 minutes every week.
